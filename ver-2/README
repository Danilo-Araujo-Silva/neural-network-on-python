This version does implement a perceptron with backpropagation.

# Unlike others, this does not separate into 2 scripts,
# because 'pickle' library does not support pickling my own class.


The backprop.py takes train data and test data.
So, you can use it by typing:

    $ python backprop.py TRAIN_DATA_FILENAME TEST_DATA_FILENAME

For easy testing, you can use the shell script of easy-test.sh:

    $ sh easy-test.sh

For measuring time, you can use measure-time.sh:

    $ sh measure-time.sh
