This version demonstrates multi-valued perceptron.

This version separates into 2 scripts:
- train.py
- test.py

The train.py takes train data and write knowledge into a given filename.
You can use it by typing:

    $ python train.py TRAIN_DATA_FILENAME OUTPUT_FILENAME

The test.py takes the knowledge data and test data file (e.g. q-ish.txt).
This program returns most likely similar letters by using a given
knowledge data. You can test it by typing:

    $ python test.py KNOWLEDGE_FILENAME TEST_DATA_FILENAME

For easy testing, you can use the shell script of easy-test.sh:

    $ sh easy-test.sh

For measuring time, you can use measure-time.sh:

    $ sh measure-time.sh
