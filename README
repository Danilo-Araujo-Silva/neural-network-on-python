This folder is a project for Project 2 in Artificial Intelligence class.

This folder is composed of the following trees:
README:	       This is me.
- letter-set:  set of letters for training.
- letter-each: set of letters for testing.
- logics:      set of prototypes for testing algorithms.
- ver-0:       demo for an algorithm of binary perceptron.
- ver-1:       demo for an algorithm of multi-valued perceptron.
- ver-2:       demo for an algorithm of backpropagation.
- ver-3:       demo for an algorithm of nearest neighbor rule.

Each folder has a README and it tells you how to run
and how to test the program there.
